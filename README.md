# Eulerian-Lagrangian-Solver
A 2-D fluid flow solver that numerically simulates a laminar jet seeded with a dilute spray into still, ambient conditions

Run in a python3 environment with 
> python wrapper.py

## Requirements
* python3 - numpy, csv, os, subprocess, sys, time, matplotlib
* gfortran
* the fhdict module included allows for a hash dictionary to be used to keep track of seeded particle IDs
